1. What is Terraform and How it works?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp Language,
    that allows me to define and provision cloud infrastructure using a declarative language called HCL.

👉 It works by first writing infrastructure configurations in .tf files. Then, 
👉 I run (terraform init) to initialize the working directory, (terraform plan) to preview the changes, 
    and (terraform apply) to provision the actual resources.

👉 Terraform maintains a state file to track infrastructure and manage changes efficiently.

👉 It supports multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and even tools like Kubernetes or GitHub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What is the Terraform state file, and why is it important?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 The Terraform state file is a JSON or binary file that stores the current state of the managed infrastructure. 

👉 State file is like a blueprint that stores information about the infrastructure you manage. 

👉 It's crucial because it helps Terraform understand what's already set up and what changes need to be made. 
    when you run (terraform plan) or (terraform apply),
    By comparing the desired setup with the current one in the state file, 
    Terraform can make accurate updates to your infrastructure.

👉 Without the state file, Terraform would have no way to know what’s already deployed, 
    making it impossible to manage resources properly or detect configuration drift.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. How do you configure remote state storage in Terraform (e.g., S3,DynamoDB)?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
To configure remote state in Terraform:
👉 I use the backend block inside the terraform block.
👉 For example, with AWS S3, I store the terraform.tfstate file in an S3 bucket and 
👉 use DynamoDB for state locking to prevent race conditions in team environments.
👉 This setup enables secure, versioned, and collaborative infrastructure management.

✅ Example: Remote State Using S3 + DynamoDB:
🔧 Steps to Set Up:
1. Create an S3 bucket (with versioning enabled).
2. Create a DynamoDB table with a primary key LockID for state locking.
3. Add the backend block to your config.
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "env/prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
4. Run:terraform init
👉 Terraform will automatically initialize the backend and migrate any existing local state.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. What are Terraform modules, and how do they help in managing infrastructure?
   You have multiple environments - dev, stage, prod for your application and you want to use the same code for all of these environment. 
   How can you do that?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Terraform modules are reusable configuration units that encapsulate related resources.

👉 Modules help organize, reuse, and scale infrastructure as code.
    Instead of repeating the same resource blocks across environments or services,
    I can define a module once and reuse it with different inputs.

✅ Why Use Modules?
Reusability     : Write once, use multiple times (e.g., a VPC, EC2, or S3 setup).
Consistency     : Enforces standardized infrastructure patterns across teams.
Maintainability : Easier updates and changes — fix in one place, apply everywhere.
Abstraction     : Hides complexity from users who only need to provide inputs.
Environment Isolation : Use the same module across dev, staging, and prod with different variables.

📦 Types of Modules:
Root Module   : The primary working directory where Terraform commands are run.
Child Modules : Modules called within the root module, either locally or from remote sources (e.g., GitHub, Terraform Registry).

✅ Example module structure:
terraform-project/
│── main.tf
│── variables.tf
│── outputs.tf
│── terraform.tfvars
│── modules/
│   └── ec2-instance/
│       ├── main.tf 
│       ├── variables.tf
│       ├── outputs.tf
│── main.tf (modules path and pass values)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. How do you use variables and outputs in Terraform to make configurations reusable?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Variables in terraform are used to parameterize configurations,it making them dynamic and reusable.
🔧 Define a Variable (variables.tf):
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Type of EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

👉 Outputs expose useful data after deployment, such as IPs or resource IDs.
🟢 Define Output (outputs.tf):
output "instance_ip" {
  description = "Public IP of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. When should you use a provisioner in Terraform? 
    There are some bash scripts that you want to run after creating your resources with terraform so how would you achieve this:

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or commands on a resource after it's created 
👉 typically for tasks like software installation or configurations.

👉 In this configuration, the remote-exec provisioner executes Bash commands on a remote machine via SSH. 
    You need to provide the necessary connection details such as the SSH user, private key, and host. 
    The inline script (script.sh) is executed on the remote machine after the resource creation.

Types of Provisioners in Terraform:
1. Local-exec: Executes commands on the machine running Terraform.
2. Remote-exec: Runs commands on the remote resource (like an EC2 instance).
✅ Execute remote Bash script after resource creation:
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "chmod +x /path/to/your/remote/script.sh",    # Ensure script is executable
    "/path/to/your/remote/script.sh",             # Execute remote script
  ]
  connection {
    # Configure connection details such as host, username, and private key
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "your-ssh-user"
    private_key = file("/path/to/your/private-key.pem")
    host        = aws_instance.example.public_ip
  }
}
3. File: Transfers files from the local system to a remote resource.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Your infrastructure contains database passwords and other sensitive information. 
    How can you manage secrets(like API keys, passwords) and sensitive data in Terraform?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Managing secrets and sensitive data in Terraform require careful consideration to ensure security. 
👉 Best practices include:
- Never Hardcode secrets in your Terraform code.
- Storing secrets outside of version-controlled files, using tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud-specific secret management services.
- Utilizing Terraform input variables or environment variables to pass sensitive values securely during runtime.

👉 By following these practices, you can protect sensitive information and minimize the risk of exposing secrets unintentionally.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. How do you debug Terraform errors and resolve failed terraform apply issues?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🛠️ My Debugging Approach
✅ 1. Read the Error Message Carefully:
👉 Terraform provides clear error messages — I start by checking the exact resource and line number causing the issue.

✅ 2. Use terraform plan:
👉 I always run terraform plan before apply to preview changes and catch issues early (e.g., invalid values, resource conflicts).

✅ 3. Enable Detailed Logs:
👉 I set the debug log level for deeper insight: (TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What are Terraform workspaces, and how do they help with environment management (e.g., dev, prod)?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Terraform workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments — like dev, staging, and prod 
    — using the same Terraform configuration but isolated state files.
👉 This helps you avoid maintaining multiple copies of the same code, while still keeping environment states separate and safe.

✅ How Workspaces Work
👉 By default, Terraform uses a default workspace.
👉 When you create a new workspace, Terraform uses a separate state file for it.
👉 The resources created in each workspace are independent.
👉 Each workspace stores its own terraform.tfstate, allowing parallel management of multiple environments from one codebase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. A DevOps Engineer manually created infrastructure on AWS, and now there is a requirement to use Terraform to manage it.
    How would you import these resources in Terraform code?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 To import existing AWS resources into Terraform, you can follow  these steps:

1. Write Terraform configuration for the resources you want to manage.
2. Run `terraform import` command for each resource, specifying the resource type and its unique identifier in AWS.

👉 For example: terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
👉 Repeat this process for each resource you want to manage with Terraform.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Jr DevOps Engineer accidently deleted the state file, what steps should we take to resolve this?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 To resolve this, I would follow a careful recovery plan to avoid infrastructure drift or duplication.

1. Check for Remote State Backup (Amazon S3): If available, restore the state file from a recent backup.

2. If No Backup Exists (Local State Only): If no backup exists, manually reconstruct the state by inspecting existing infrastructure 
    and using `terraform import` for missing resources.

3. Review and Prevent: Analyze the incident, implement preventive measures, 
   and educate team members on best practices to avoid similar incidents in the future.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. What are some best practices to manage terraform state file?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Use Remote State Backends: Store the state file remotely (e.g., AWS S3) for safety, collaboration and version control.

2. Enable State Locking: Enable state locking to prevent conflicts in concurrent operations.

3. Access Controls: Limit access to the state file to authorized users and services.

4. Automated Backups: Set up automated backups to prevent data loss.

5. Environment Separation: Maintain separate state files for each environment or 
   utilize Terraform workspaces to manage multiple state files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Your company wants to automate Terraform through CICD pipelines. How can you integrate Terraform with CI/CD pipelines?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Terraform can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure. 
👉 Here's the typical process:

- Commit the Terraform configurations to a version control system (e.g., Git).

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline that monitors changes to the Terraform code repository.

- In the pipeline, execute Terraform commands such as init, validate, and plan,
  to ensure the configurations are valid and generate an execution plan.

- Use Terraform's apply command to create or modify infrastructure based on the approved changes.

- Optionally, leverage infrastructure testing and verification tools to validate the deployed infrastructure.

- Finally, trigger additional pipeline stages for application deployment, testing, and release.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. You have 20 servers created through Terraform but you want to delete one of them. 
    Is it possible to destroy a single resource out of multiple resources using Terraform?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Yes, it is possible. We can use the terraform destroy -target command followed by the resource type and name,
    to destroy a specific resource.

👉 Here's an example: (terraform destroy -target=aws_instance.my_instance)
👉 In this example, only the AWS instance named my_instance would be destroyed, leaving other resources managed by Terraform intact.
