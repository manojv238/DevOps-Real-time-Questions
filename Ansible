1. What is Ansible and how does it work?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Ansible is an agentless automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.
👉 It uses YAML-based playbooks and connects to remote servers over SSH to run tasks using built-in modules.
👉 It's simple, scalable, and idempotent, which means it doesn't repeat actions if they're already done.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. What are the key features of Ansible?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 Agentless  ----------–> No need to install agents on managed nodes.
📌 Simple YAML Syntax –--> Uses human-readable YAML for playbooks.
📌 Idempotency –---------> Ensures changes apply only when needed.
📌 Scalability –---------> Manages thousands of servers efficiently.
📌 Pre-built Modules –---> Extensive library for automation tasks.
📌 Orchestration  –------> Automates multi-tier app deployments.
📌 Secure & Reliable –---> Uses SSH and Ansible Vault for security.
📌 Push Model Execution –> Executes tasks from the control node directly.

3. Difference Between Ansible, Shell, and Python?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 Shell (Bash/PowerShell):
✅ Good for one-time execution for shell script but lacks of scalability for complex automation.
🔹 Example: Shell is won't work with different OS.(linux,ubuntu,windows).

📌 Python:
✅ More flexible than Shell, supports both Linux and Windows.
🔹 Example: Writing a script to manage multiple services dynamically.

📌 Ansible:
✅ Best for managing multiple VMs with different OS types.
✅ Uses inventory files to define different hosts and apply the right module automatically.
🔹 Example: Write a Playbook, configure, and start Nginx on multiple servers.

📌📌📌 Final Recommendation:
✅ If it's a one-time task, use Shell scripts.
✅ If you want custom logic & flexibility, use Python.
✅ If you need scalability, reusability, and automation, Ansible is the best choice.

4. How do you define and manage inventory in Ansible?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 Inventory defines the list of servers where automation tasks run. 
1. Static Inventory (Default: /etc/ansible/hosts):-
2. Dynamic Inventory (For Cloud Environments: AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.):-

👉 I've used both static and dynamic inventories depending on the environment. 
   A simple file with manually defined hosts and groups like [webservers], [dbservers].
🔹 Example (inventory.ini): "ini-Extention"
--------------------------------------------------------
[web]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 ansible_user=ubuntu

[db]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20 ansible_user=root
--------------------------------------------------------
👉 In cloud environments like AWS, I used dynamic inventory with the aws_ec2 plugin, 
    where hosts were grouped automatically based on tags (e.g., Environment=dev or App=dms). 
    This way, the inventory was always up to date without manual intervention.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Difference Between Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands and Playbooks?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Ad-Hoc Commands are One-time commands and used for simple tasks on managed nodes.
   They are primarily used for tasks like checking connectivity, managing services, and installing packages.

👉 Use Case: Restarting a service, checking uptime, or running a quick shell command.

2. Ansible Playbooks are YAML-based automation scripts that define a set of tasks to be executed on one or more hosts.
   It allows you to describe the desired state of your systems in a structured, readable format 
   like installing packages, managing files, configuring services, or deploying applications.

👉 Use Case: Automating infrastructure setup, application deployments, and configuration management.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Can you explain any playbook that you wrote and found to be effective?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 This playbook is used to install and configure Apache web server on a group of servers called webservers.

👉 It uses the apt module to install the Apache package.

👉 Then, it uses the service module to make sure Apache is started and enabled at boot.

👉 Finally, it copies a custom index.html file to the web root using the copy module.

👉 I’ve defined apache_package as a variable so it's easier to override if we want to use a different package on another OS 
    (like httpd on CentOS).

👉 Also, the playbook uses become: yes to run the tasks as root, which is needed for package installation and service management.

🧾 Use Case Playbook: Install Apache on a group of web servers:
---
- name: Install and start Apache web server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  vars:
    apache_package: apache2

  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: "{{ apache_package }}"
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Start and enable Apache service
      service:
        name: "{{ apache_package }}"
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Deploy custom index.html
      copy:
        src: files/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Can you explain a struched andible playbook using roles?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 An Ansible Role is a way to organize automation tasks logically and modularly.
👉 Roles structure playbooks into reusable components, making automation scalability, maintainable, reusable across different projects.
📁 Ansible Project Structure with Roles:
my-ansible-project/
├── inventory/
│   └── hosts               # Inventory file (static or dynamic)
├── group_vars/
│   └── all.yml             # Global variables for all hosts
├── roles/
│   └── apache/             # A role named "apache"
│       ├── tasks/
│       │   └── main.yml    # Tasks to install and configure Apache
│       ├── handlers/
│       │   └── main.yml    # Restart Apache if config changes
│       ├── templates/
│       │   └── httpd.conf.j2  # Jinja2 template for Apache config
│       ├── files/
│       │   └── index.html  # Static file to copy to server
│       ├── vars/
│       │   └── main.yml    # Role-specific variables
│       └── defaults/
│           └── main.yml    # Default variables (can be overridden)
├── site.yml                # Main playbook

📝 site.yml – Main Playbook File:
---
- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  roles:
    - apache

👉 This is a well-structured Ansible project using roles for modularity. 
👉 Each role (like apache) contains everything it needs to manage that component – tasks, handlers, templates, files, and variables.

👉 The site.yml playbook is the entry point and simply includes the required roles. 
    This makes the project more maintainable, reusable, and readable.

👉 For example, in one of my projects, I had separate roles for Prometheus, Grafana, Docker, and Node Exporter. 
    Each team could work independently on their own role, which improved collaboration and made CI/CD integration much easier."

9. How do you use Handlers in Ansible? How do you implement when conditions in a playbook?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 In Ansible, (handlers) are special tasks that run only when notified by another task. 
👉 They are used for actions like restarting services only if a change occurred,which improves performance and avoids unnecessary restarts.
📦 Use Case Example: handlers/main.yml
- name: Restart Apache
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted

👉 The (when) clause in Ansible allows you to run tasks conditionally based on variables, facts, or any logic.
📦 Use Case Example: Install Apache only on Ubuntu:
- name: Install Apache on Ubuntu
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. How do you manage sensitive data securely in Ansible using Vault?

EXPLAIN IN THIS ANSWER:-
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
👉 In Ansible, Vault is used to encrypt sensitive data like passwords, tokens, API keys, SSH credentials, and private certificates.
👉 This ensures that confidential information is not exposed in plain text, especially when sharing code through Git.

🛠️ How It Works:
👉 To create a new Vault file: (ansible-vault create secrets.yml)
👉 To encrypt an existing file: (ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/prod.yml)
👉 To edit a vault-encrypted file: (ansible-vault edit secrets.yml)
👉 To use the Vault in a playbook:
vars_files:
  - secrets.yml
👉 To run a playbook using Vault: (ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass)
👉 Or using a vault password file: (ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt)

✅ Answer (with explanation):
👉 In the Infra Services project, we stored AWS keys, DB passwords, 
    and other secrets in Vault-encrypted files inside group_vars and host_vars.
    This allowed us to safely version-control our playbooks in Git without exposing credentials.
👉 We used a vault password file secured in Jenkins to run playbooks automatically without human intervention.
